      <h3 id="acapella">A Capella</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently part of a acapella group called Killer Quines. Its Aberdeen University's only treble voice A Cappella group. We recently took part in International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella and the Scottish A Cappella Championships where we won an award for our coreography.

      <h3 id="compClub">Computing Club</h3>
      <p>
        During my final year of high school I helped to provide a space for girls to explore their interest in a veriaty of aspects of computer science. This was done through a girls coding club where members build skills like teamwork, time management, confidence, communication, and basic programing consepts through scratch and python.
      </p>
      <h3 id="ysl">Young Stem Leader</h3>
      <p>
        It provided me with skills to support, engage and inspire others in STEM in my school by running a coding club. It helped me advance my leadership, communication and resilience skills whilst helping others engage with STEM in fun, encouraging and informative ways.
      </p>
      <h3 id="videoGames">Video Games</h3>
      <p>
        I find video games entertaining. Although I don't play them as much as I did when I was younger I will still play farming simulators to wind down or RPGs to entertain myself.
      </p>
      <h3 id="bake">Baking</h3>
      <p>
        I often bake during my spare time. I enjoy the process of following recipes as they allow me to turn of my brain and relax. But I also enjoy making up my own versions of recapies or coming up with my own recapies entirely.
