still to include: technical details of the chat's client-server

 !!NOTE!!: for this web application to run you must enter the commands:
  cd CA4 and then the command node index.js in the terminal.
  Also a flaw I encountered the mp4 file for my coding project 
  is to big to upload to github so it is untracked but still important.
  If i were to do this project again i would make sure I had smaller videos to upload
  beforehand.

Design discussion:

Objective:
develop a website that functions a personal and professional portfolio and includes a chat application.
  
  Constraints: 

    Technical:
    I will be using HTML, css, and javasript to make this website
    I will use the online IDE codio to develop this site

    Time:
    The deadline is the 3rd of April

    Economic:
    There is no cost as all software I am using is free

    Legal:
    For images I will be using my own artwork and projects, or using royalty free images in due accordance with GDPR copy right laws.
    All software used is open source so there is no need for a license.

  Requirements:
  All text on each page is readable
  The home page must have the text "My Portfolio" in the center and informational text should be below it
  The text on the home page must describe the function of each page in the website 
  All Images must be visible
  On smaller view ports the text (i.e. mobile, tablet etc..), images an navigation bar mush adjust to fit the view port

  Challenges faced:
  integrating the notifications into the current 
  code for the chat application. I researched 
  for similar projects and found a chat application by Traversy
  Media that greatly helped me understand the Java Script code more. 
  I also looked at past lectures from this course and used my 
  own problem solving skills to overcome this challenge


Completeness:
were the things discussed in the design staged achieved?

  Navigation: 
  I have successfully implemented and designed a navigation bar 
  that will be consistent throughout my website. 
  I have also implemented a side navigation bar that allows the 
  user to jump to specific sections within certain pages. 
  It is also responsive as depending on the size of the view port 
  its dimensions change to give it a consistent look.

  Layout and responsiveness: 
  My overall layout remains consistent 
  with text sizes and headers being consistent throughout the site. 
  It is also responsive as they adjust base on the size of the view 
  port

  Conclusion:
  overall, this website completes its main goals of having a 
  functional chat page with notifications that let you know of 
  specific user events. It also achieves the goal of being a personal 
  and professional portfolio as it contains details on the clients 
  personal and professional interests, projects, and general details. 
  And it remains responsive and eye catching throughout due to its use 
  of vw (making elements relevant to the width of the viewport)and its cohesive
  colour scheme and interesting images
